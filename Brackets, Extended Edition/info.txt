Goal
You must determine whether a given expression's bracketing can be made valid by flipping them in-place. 
An expression has a valid bracketing when all the parentheses (), square brackets [], curly braces {} and angle brackets <> are correctly paired and nested.

You can flip a bracketing element in-place by replacing it with its counterpart, e.g. replace a ( with a ), or a > with a <. 
For example, converting the second parenthesis in the expression below would make it valid:

<{[(abc(]}> → <{[(abc)]}>

Input
Line 1: the number N of expressions
Next N lines: an expression

Output
N lines: true if the expression can be made valid by flipping elements in-place; false otherwise.
Constraints

N ≤ 50
expression length ≤ 10000
number of bracketing elements ≤ 25
The expression contains no whitespace.
