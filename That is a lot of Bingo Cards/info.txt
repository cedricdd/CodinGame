Goal
Background:
Bingo Cards are used in the game of Bingo:
➧ A Card consists of the header "BINGO" and a 5x5 square of 24 numbers and 1 "free space"
➤ (The square is 5x5 because "BINGO" is 5 letters long)
➧ There are 75 possible numbers that can go on a Card:
➤ Each number is only allowed in a certain column; For example, numbers 1-15 can only go in the first column, numbers 16-30 can only go in the second column, etc
➤ There are no duplicate numbers on a Card

There are a gigantic number of unique Cards possible: about 552 Septillion
(552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 to be exact)

See discussion here:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1451218/how-many-bingo-card-combinations-are-there

But ... Variations:
But what if there were alternative Bingo Card styles, such as
‣ different headers, therefore different square sizes
‣ different free space(s), at various locations on the Card
(See banner image for examples)
‣ different number of Balls

Your task:
You will see a variation.
On the Bingo Card shown: fr indicates a "free space" and a dot (.) indicates where the numbers can go

In this given variation, how many unique Cards are possible?
NOTE: You won't be able to output the actual calculated total because it is likely just too large.
Instead output the equation needed to calculate the total

Output format:
The equation (that will produce the total) should be shown in this simplified format:

b1^n1 * b2^n2 * b3^n3 etc

where the bs are in descending order
(If an n is 1, don't print ^1 since that is not needed)

For example,
8 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 9 * 8
should print out as
9^2 * 8^3 * 7

Input
Line 1: An integer numOfBalls the number of Balls
Line 2: An integer heightOfBingoCard height of Bingo Card
Next heightOfBingoCard Lines: Strings, each line of the Bingo Card, including the header

Output
A string equation as described in the statement
NOTE: There is a space on both sides of each *

Constraints
• numOfBalls is a multiple of header length
• numOfBalls is more than (header length) x (header length)
• 2 < (header length) < 10
