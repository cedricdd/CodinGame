Goal
Create a rectangular grid of * such that the top left point is always 0,0 (and coordinates increase along the X-axis and the Y-axis); and the height and width are HI and WI.

This grid will have a style of either expanded or condensed:
‣ if expanded, add a space between *'s in each row.
‣ if condensed, do not.

Carve out triangles from that grid. If part (or all) of a triangle is already carved out, then add those parts back, thus "Triangle Toggle".

Note:
‣ "carve out" means replacing each * in the triangle (its edges and its inside) with a space character.
‣ A triangle is sometimes not fully on the grid, but at least some of it is.

Input
Line 1: 2 integers: HI WI space-separated
Line 2: a string style that is either condensed or expanded
Line 3: an integer howManyTriangles to show how many Triangles you will carve
Next howManyTriangles Lines: 6 space-separated integers representing a single triangle, X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X3 Y3. Each pair of X and Y represents the X and Y-coordinates of one vertex of the triangle.

Output
HI Lines: The carved out grid.
Constraints

5 < HI, WI < 50
0 < howManyTriangles < 10
-20 < every X, every Y < 70
