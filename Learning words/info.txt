Goal
Lisa wants to learn English with minimum effort, and she has prepared a text to study.

Her objective is to learn the minimum amount of words while reaching her comprehension target. Here, her target is to understand ALL the sentences. 
To "understand a sentence" she sets the bar at understanding 50% of the words. Find the amount of words she needs to learn.

Notes:
(1) For this puzzle there are no duplicate words inside the sentences.
(2) If the sentence is of odd length, round the half up. That is if it's 3, you'd need 2 words, if 7, 4 etc.
(3) The text only contains English letters and spaces to differentiate the words.
(4) Ignore case when comparing words. Hello is equal to hello.


Input
Line 1: An integer n for the number of sentences.
Next N lines: A string sentence.

Output
The minimum amount of words that Lisa has to learn to reach her target.
Constraints

0 < n < 100
0 < length of sentence < 500
The total amount of words across all sentences is lower than 1000
