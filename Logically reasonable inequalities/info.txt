Goal
We are looking at a system of inequalities. Here all inequalities are simple and consist of one variable on each side. 
Considering a system of strict inequalities, determine whether this system is inherently consistent or if there is a flaw. 
A flaw is a contradiction of two or more inequalities, e.g. A > B > C > A. This is not possible from a logical point of view.

Input
Line 1: a positive integer n
The following n lines: inequalities of format LETTER > LETTER

Output
A string "consistent" if all inequalities are consistent or "contradiction" if there is a contradiction found.

Constraints
0 < n < 26
LETTER is a single letter in uppercase
