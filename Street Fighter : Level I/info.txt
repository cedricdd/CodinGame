Goal
Given two champions with list of hits performed by each of them, output who is the winner and number of hits he strikes on his opponent.

Rules:
- All champions start with rage = 0
- When a champion is hit, his/her rage increases by one.
- When a champion uses special attack, his/her rage restarts at 0.
- The fight stops when we reach the last line read or when one fighter is dead (life <= 0)

In the input, each hit is preceded by the direction of the attack:
- > means champion1 hits champion2.
- < means champion2 hits champion1.

The table below shows the starting life and the damage caused by punch, kick and special attack of the champions.

Champ.|Life|Punch|Kick|Special Attack
KEN   |25  |6    |5   |3*rage
RYU   |25  |4    |5   |4*rage
TANK  |50  |2    |2   |2*rage
VLAD  |30  |3    |3   |2*(rage+opp.rage);opp.rage=0
JADE  |20  |2    |7   |number of hits made*rage
ANNA  |18  |9    |1   |damage received*rage
JUN   |60  |2    |1   |rage; and rage is added to JUN's life
