Goal
Sort a list of integer values in alphabetical order of their standard-form Roman numeral representations.
I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000
IV=4, IX=9, XL=40, XC=90, CD=400, CM=900

Note that:
49 = XLIX, not IL
999 = CMXCIX, not IM

EXAMPLE
3
44
63
97

44 = XLIV, alphabetically 3rd
63 = LXIII, alphabetically 1st
97 = XCVII, alphabetically 2nd

Output:
63 97 44

Input
Line 1: An integer n, the number of integers to be sort
Next n lines: a positive integer x

Output
The n integers from the input, space-separated and arranged in alphabetical order of the Roman-numeral representation of each x

Constraints

1 <= x <= 3999
