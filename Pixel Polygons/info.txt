Goal
You have an NxN grid consisting of white and black square pixels. White pixels are represented by . and black pixels are represented by #. The pixels on the outer edges of the grid are all white.

The black pixels form a single connected shape without any holes (no white pixel is surrounded on all four sides with black pixels). How many sides does it have?

Input
Line 1: An integer N - the size of the grid
Next N lines: - the rows of the grid

Output
Line 1: The number of sides the black region has.

Constraints
- 3 ≤ N ≤ 10
- The pixels on the outer edge of the grid are all white.
- The black pixels form a single connected region.
- No white pixel is surrounded on all four sides with black pixels.
