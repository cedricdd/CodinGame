Goal
You manufacture custom picture-frames for couples, such that:
~ the wife's name goes across the top and down the right side
~ the husband's name goes down the left side and across the bottom

Given the names of the wife and husband (or Partner#1 and Partner#2 if you prefer), draw the smallest frame possible.

Note: Don't split a name, such that part is vertical and part is horizontal.

Input
Line 1: A string wife, denoting wife's name
Line 2: A string husband, denoting husband's name

Output
Multiple Lines: That picture frame
