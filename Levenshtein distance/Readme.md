# Puzzle
**Levenshtein distance** https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/levenshtein-distance

# Goal
You must find the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

The Levenstein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

Ex: "kitten" and "sitting". The distance is 3.

kitten -> kittin -> sittin -> sitting

NB: This distance has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition and many other.

# Input
* Line 1 : First string
* Line 2 : Second string

# Output
* Line 1 : The Levenshtein distance

# Constraints
* The length of the strings does not exceed 50.
