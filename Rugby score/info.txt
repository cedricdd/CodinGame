Given a rugby score, your program must compute the different scoring combinations that lead to that particular score.
As a reminder:
- a try is worth 5 points
- after a try, a transformation kick is played and is worth 2 extra points if successful
- penalty kicks and drops are worth 3 points

Input
Line 1: the score

Output
N lines: number of tries, number of transformations, number of penalties / drops, separated by spaces
The combinations must be ordered by increasing order of tries, then transformations, then penalties/drops

Constraints
No impossible scores are given, there is always at least one valid combination.
