Goal
Given a W×H image, with W and H both even, we define its photo booth transformation as the image obtained after the following process:
- Divide the image into 2×2 blocks (which is possible as both dimensions are even);
- Build four W/2×H/2 images by gathering the top-left pixels of each block into one image (following the blocks ordering) and similarly the top-right / bottom-left / bottom-right pixels into three other images;
- Glue together these four images (following the inside-block ordering) to obtain a new W×H image.

Example: 6×4 image

┌──────┐      ┌──┬──┬──┐      ┌───┬───┐      ┌──────┐
│ABCDEF│      │AB│CD│EF│      │ACE│BDF│      │ACEBDF│
│GHIJKL│      │GH│IJ│KL│      │MOQ│NPR│      │MOQNPR│
│MNOPQR│  ~>  ├──┼──┼──┤  ~>  ├───┼───┤  ~>  │GIKHJL│
│STUVWX│      │MN│OP│QR│      │GIK│HJL│      │SUWTVX│
└──────┘      │ST│UV│WX│      │SUW│TVX│      └──────┘
              └──┴──┴──┘      └───┴───┘

This transformation results in an image which contains four reduced versions of the original image, though none of them have a single a pixel in common (each of them contains exactly 1/4 of the original pixels).

Iterating this transform from a given image always brings us back to the original image after a (positive) number of steps that we call a period of the image.

Given some even dimensions W and H, what is the minimum period common to all W×H images?

Back to the example: Assuming all pixel values are distinct, we have:

┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐
│ABCDEF│    │ACEBDF│    │AEDCBF│    │ADBECF│    │ABCDEF│
│GHIJKL│    │MOQNPR│    │GKJIHL│    │MPNQOR│    │GHIJKL│
│MNOPQR│ ~> │GIKHJL│ ~> │MQPONR│ ~> │GJHKIL│ ~> │MNOPQR│
│STUVWX│    │SUWTVX│    │SWVUTX│    │SVTWUX│    │STUVWX│
└──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘

Hence the minimum period is 4.

Input
Line 1: One single integer T for the number of testcases to follow.
Next T lines: Two space-separated integers Wi and Hi corresponding to the width and height of the image.

Output
T lines: One single integer corresponding to the period of the photo booth map on Wi×Hi images.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ W, H ≤ 2000
Both W and H are even.
