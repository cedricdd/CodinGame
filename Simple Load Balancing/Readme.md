# Puzzle
**Simple Load Balancing** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/simple-load-balancing

# Goal
In this challenge, you are given N servers. Each server has a current load Li jobs running on it.   
Then a batch k jobs comes and must be distributed on the N servers.   
Your job is to design a program that will distribute the incoming k jobs on the servers such that the difference of the number of jobs in the server with the highest load and the one with the lowest load is minimal. Letâ€™s call this metric Minimal Imbalance.  
For example if we have N=4 and the initial loads as follows [5,0,2,1].   
For k=3 arriving jobs, distributing the jobs to get the following [5,2,2,2] achieves the Minimal Imbalance. The result here is 3 (5-2)  
This challenge was one of the problems in Amazon Last Mile 22.  

# Input
* Line 1: N An integer denoting the number of servers
* Line 2: k An integer denoting the number of jobs to be scheduled
* Line 3: One line containing integers Li where each integer denotes the server current load

# Output
* An integer denoting the minimum achievable imbalance after scheduling the k jobs.

# Constraints
* 1 <= N < 10000
* 0 <= Li <= 10000
* 0 <= k <= 100000000
