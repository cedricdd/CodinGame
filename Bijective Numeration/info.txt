Goal
Decimal isn't the only base ten positional numbering system!

Write a simple calculator that operates entirely in "decimary" notation to sum a list of positive integer values. Decimary is a fun name for what mathematics calls bijective numeration base ten, which uses A to represent ten and lacks a zero digit.

The system is better illustrated than explained. Starting from one, these numerals are written:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A = ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A = ten plus ten = twenty, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 2A = thirty, 31, ...

88, 89, 8A = ninety, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 9A = ninety plus ten = one hundred, A1 = a hundred and one, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, AA = a hundred and ten, 111, ...

199, 19A = two hundred, 1A1 = two hundred and one, ...

Input
Line 1: An integer count representing the number of input values
Line 2: A string of decimary values, separated by spaces

Output
Line 1: A string in "decimary" notation representing the summation

Constraints
2 <= count < 10
1 <= length of each decimary representation < 10
