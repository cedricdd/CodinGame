# Puzzle
**Excavating Palindromes** https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1156146d442abd1af9d939579c1417e72dfe3e

# Goal
You are given a string s consisting of alphanumeric characters and underscores. By removing some characters from the string (but not reordering them), you can create a palindrome.

Your task is to determine the length of the longest palindrome that can be made.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
- Examples: a, aba, aabbaa.
- Non-examples: ab, abc, aabbaaa.

Case is important: ABBA is a palindrome, but Abba is not.

# Input
* Line 1: The string s

# Output
* Line 1: The length of the longest palindrome that can be formed from s

# Constraints
* 1 ≤ length of s ≤ 30
