# Puzzle
**Sum of divisors** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sum-of-divisors

# Goal
You have to print the sum of divisors of all the numbers from 1 to n.  
It’s superfast when you know the trick but you have to find it.  
For example if n=4, lets define d(n) the set of the divisors of n:  
* d(1)={1},
* d(2)={1,2},
* d(3)={1,3},
* d(4)={1,2,4}.
* 
And their sum is 1+1+2+1+3+1+2+4=15.

Look carefully at the divisors to find the trick.

# Input
* A single number n

# Output
* The sum

# Constraints
* 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 100000
