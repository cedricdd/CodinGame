Goal
Consider the following conditions to build a string of length characters:
• Must contain only characters from the given alphabet.
• The same character may appear twice or more.
• The resulting string does not need to have a meaning in English or any other language.

• Must satisfy the given set of rules. The rules are given in a code of 3 symbols:
- The first one denotes if a given character must exist or not.
   + means must exist.
   - means must not exist.
- The second one is the character which must or must not exist.
- The third one is the position where the character must exist or not.
   0 (zero) means somewhere/anywhere. Possible values other than 0 are 1 to length (inclusive).

Please answer the number of strings that satisfy all these conditions.

Input
Line 1: An integer a_len for the length of the alphabet.
Line 2: A string alphabet for the alphabet.
Line 3: An integer length for the length of the word to generate.
Line 4: An integer rule_n the number of rules.
Next rule_n lines: A string rules for the rules to satisfy.

Output
Line 1: A single line containing the number of strings that you are able to create.

Constraints
0 < a_len ≤ 30
1 ≤ length ≤ 8
0 ≤ rule_n ≤ 6
