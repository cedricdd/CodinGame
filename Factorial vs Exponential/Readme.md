# Goal
For each of the given numbers A, find the smallest integer N, such that A^N < N! , where N! = 1 * 2 * ... * N  
The numbers given can have up to 2 digits after decimal point.

# Input
* Line 1: An integer K for the number of inputs.
* Line 2: K space separated numbers (can have a fractional part, e.g. 1.5): A_1, A_2, ... , A_K

# Output
* Line 1: K space separated integers: N_1, N_2, ... , N_K.

# Constraints
