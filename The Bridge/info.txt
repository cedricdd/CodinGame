Goal:
The program:

There are 4 lanes on the bridge road and 1 to 4 bikes to control. There can only be one moto per lane and they are always vertically aligned.

Each game turn, you can send a single instruction to every bike. Since  the bikes operate on the same frequency, they will all synchronize on the commands you send them.

The possible commands are:
    SPEED to speed up by 1.
    SLOW to slow down by 1.
    JUMP to jump.
    WAIT to go straight on.
    UP to send all motorbikes one lane up.
    DOWN to send all motorbikes one lane down.


The starting speeds of the bikes are synced, and can be 0. After every game turn, the bikes will move a number of squares equal to their current speed across the X axis.

The UP and DOWN instructions will make the bikes move across the Y axis in addition to the movement across the X axis (Y = 0 corresponds to the highest lane). 
If a motorbike is prevented from moving up or down by the bridge's guard rails, none of the bikes will move on the Y axis that turn.

When a motorbike goes in a straight line and does not jump, if there is a hole between the current position and the next position (after the move), then the motorbike is lost forever. 
For example, if X=2 and S=3, the next position of the bike will have X=5: if there is a hole in X=3, X=4 or X=5, the bike will be destroyed.

INITIALIZATION INPUT:

Line 1 : M the amount of motorbikes to control.
Line 2 : V the minimum amount of motorbikes that must survive.
Lines 3 through 6: the road ahead. Each line represents one lane of the road. A dot character . represents a safe space, a zero 0 represents a hole in the road.

INPUT FOR ONE GAME TURN:
Line 1 : S the motorbikes' speed.
Next M lines: X Y A two integers and a boolean seperated by spaces. 
X, Y the coordinates of the motorbike on the road and A to indicate whether the motorbike is activated "1" or detroyed "0".

OUTPUT FOR ONE GAME TURN:
A single line containing one of 6 keywords: SPEED SLOW JUMP WAIT UP DOWN.

CONSTRAINTS:
The initial positions of the motorbikes are always X= 0.
0 ≤ S < 50
1 ≤ M ≤ 4
1 ≤ V ≤ M
0 ≤ X < 500
0 ≤ Y < 4
Response time for one game turn ≤ 150ms
