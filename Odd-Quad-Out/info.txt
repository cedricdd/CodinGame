Goal
Overview: Which of the 4 quadrant-values is different than the others?

Details:
You will be given a square table (sqTable), with a sideSize of an even-number (such as 4, 6, 8 etc).
This sqTable can be thought of as having 4 equal quadrants (quads).

Each cell in sqTable contains either nothing (represented by .) or a number from 1 to 9.

The value of each quad is equal to the sum of the numbers in it.

Your Task:
Find the oddQuad that has a different value (oddValue) than the other quads.
The other three quads will have the standardValue.

Note:
The oddValue might be larger or smaller than the standardValue

-----------------------
|          |          |
|  Quad-1  |  Quad-2  |
|          |          |
-----------------------
|          |          |
|  Quad-3  |  Quad-4  |
|          |          |
-----------------------

Input
Line 1: An integer, sideSize

Next sideSize Lines: A string that is sideSize long, consisting only of . and digits (1 through 9)

Output
Line 1: Quad-oddQuad is Odd-Quad-Out
Line 2: It has value of oddValue
Line 3: Others have value of standardValue

Constraints
sideSize is an even-number
4 ≤ sideSize ≤ 30
