**2×2×2 Rubik’s cube movements** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/222-rubiks-cube-movements

# Goal
You have to print the colours of the Front side of a 2×2×2 Rubik’s cube after some moves.  
The colours are named by the first letter of each side (Front, Back, Right, Left, Up, Down).  
The moves are named the same way if you turn the side clockwise.  
For example F moves the Front side clockwise, F' turns it anticlockwise and F2 turns it twice. B turns it clockwise when you look at the Back side.  
You won’t be given moves such as F5, B52 or U'3.  

# Input
* The moves in one single line, for example B' possibly with dots (for human readability, you can ignore them).

# Output
* The colours in two lines, for example:
  
FF  
RR
