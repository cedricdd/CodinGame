# Goal
You are at the reception desk of a 4-floor hotel and a group of c customers arrive and ask for a room.

But what should have been a routine task becomes a nightmare when you realise they have very specific demands !

Your job is to assign a floor (from 0 to 3) for each of them while respecting their r rules.

There are 10 types of rules:  
* customer_name is at floor y
* customer_name is NOT at floor y
* There's nobody at floor y
* There are exactly two customers at floor y
* customer_name is alone at his/her floor
* customer_name is with two other customers at his/her floor
* customer_name is just above customer_name
* customer_name is higher than customer_name
* customer_name is at the same floor as customer_name
* customer_name is NOT at the same floor as customer_name

There is a unique solution for each test.

This puzzle is inspired by the boardgame Gamme Logic - HÃ´tel
