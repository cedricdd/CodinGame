Line 1 : The size of the grid, h : height & w : width .
Line 2 : The number of hidden mines, nb.
h following lines : Content of the grid made of ., ? and n.

Output
nb lines including mine's location : col & lin separated by a space.
In column ascending order, then in line ascending order for the same column.

Constraints
3 ≤ h, w ≤ 20
1 ≤ nb ≤ 20
