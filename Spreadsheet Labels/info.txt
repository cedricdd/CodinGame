Goal
Spreadsheets commonly use numeric labels for each row, and alphabetic labels for each column. The alphabetic labels follow this pattern:

A, B, C... Z,
AA, AB, AC... AZ
BA, BB, BC... ZZ
AAA, AAB, AAC...

Your program should consume a list of labels and transform each label to the opposite label type:
When a number is provided, output the corresponding alphabetic label.
When an alphabetic label is provided, output the corresponding number.

Keep in mind, the numeric labels are one-indexed (1 = A, 2 = B, etc). There is no zero.

Input
Line 1: an integer N
Line 2: a space-separated string of N labels (mix of numeric and alphabetic labels)

Output
Line 1: a space-separated string of N labels in the order they appeared in the input string, but with each converted to the opposite label type (numeric to alphabetic and vice versa).

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
