Goal
You must rearrange the digits in the string S into two numbers A and B according to the following rules:
0 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^18;
No leading 0's. "0" is a valid number; "000" is not;
Minimize A, then minimize B.

Input
The first and the only line contains string S consisting of digits only.

Output
Output two numbers A and B separated by space. If such numbers can't be formed then output -1 -1.

Constraints
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 50
0 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^18
