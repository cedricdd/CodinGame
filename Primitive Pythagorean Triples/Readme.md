# Puzzle
**Primitive Pythagorean Triples** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/primitive-pythagorean-triples

# Goal
In this problem, we are given an input integer N, and your goal is to find the number of all primitive Pythagorean triples up to and including N.

A Pythagorean triple is a triple (a, b, c), where a, b and c are positive integers such that a² + b² = c². We want to find the number of all of these triples, such as 0 < a, b, c ≤ N, with a < b < c and exclude any multiples of other triples. For example, we do not want to count the triple (6, 8, 10), since it is a multiple of the triple (3, 4, 5).

# Input
* Line 1: An integer N.

# Output
* Line 1: Number of all primitive Pythagorean triples up to and including N.

# Constraints
* 0 < N ≤ 10⁶
