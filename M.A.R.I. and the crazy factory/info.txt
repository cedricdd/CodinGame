Goal
M.A.R.I. is a Mobile Autonomous Robotic Intelligence who works in a factory.
After a thunder storm, the factory has gone crazy and you need to help her fixing it, crossing the factory to the last room where the central command is.

Instructions
Here are M.A.R.I.’s instructions:
* p1 Go 1 square forward
* p2 Go 2 squares forward
* nop Do nothing (use it only as the last instruction of a set)
* tl Turn left
* tr Turn right
* bk Drop the following instructions in the set
* x2 Run twice the next instruction
* uk Use key (to move the door)
* zl Turn left then becomes a zr
* zr Turn right then becomes a zl

How to play
But M.A.R.I. is also a bit messed up.
You must play the instructions one by one.
Each time you use an instruction from the list, M.A.R.I. plays the complete set of instructions from the beginning of the set, not only the one you used.
You can insert the new instruction wherever you want.
You might not use all the instructions.
The first instruction is already engaged but you must use one of the next ones in order to move M.A.R.I.
If the instruction list begins with a space, no instruction is already engaged.

Example
The solution to the first room is p2 p1 p2 p1 tr p2. But why?
First set, you play p2. She has not reached the exit so you must use another instruction.
Second set, you insert p1 before p2, M.A.R.I. must execute p1 p2. Still not on the exit.
Third set, finally you insert tr between p1 and p2, follows p1 tr p2. M.A.R.I. reaches the exit. Well done!
Just write these six instructions.

The rooms
Each room is 5 squares wide and 7 squares high. M.A.R.I. must not go out!
Here is the meaning of the squares:
* # Wall, do not bump into
* . Empty square
* 0 north 1 east 2 south 3 west is the initial position and direction of M.A.R.I.
* E The exit where you need to end a set of instructions to finish the game
* G A gear unfortunately fallen on the ground. You can only push it (like sokoban)
* k If this tile is present, you need to grab it to finish the game or to use the door; and to end an instruction on it to grab it (beware of p2)
* dd Moving see-saw door. Don’t crush M.A.R.I.!
* r Railway for the door, you can walk on it if the door is not there
* W Railway for the door inside a wall, same as # for M.A.R.I.

Input
Line 1: The instructions
Next 7 lines: The room

Output
The instructions that bring M.A.R.I. to the exit

Constraints
Each room has got only one solution if nop is used as the last instruction.
