Goal
Zeckendorf's theorem asserts that each positive integer can be expressed uniquely as the sum of one or more non-consecutive positive Fibonacci numbers.
This unique decomposition is called Zeckendorf representation.

The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence that starts with 0 and 1 then the sum of the previous terms, it goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The objective of this puzzle is to output the Zeckendorf representation of a given integer N.

Example: for N = 64 :
The Zeckendorf representation is 64 = 55 + 8 + 1. The output in this case should be 55+8+1

Note:
There are other ways of representing 64 as the sum of Fibonacci numbers

64 = 55 + 5 + 3 + 1
64 = 34 + 21 + 8 + 1
64 = 34 + 21 + 5 + 3 + 1
64 = 34 + 13 + 8 + 5 + 3 + 1

but these are not Zeckendorf representations because 34 and 21 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, as are 5 and 3.

Input
Line 1: A positive integer N

Output
Line 1: Plus-separated non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers whose sum is N, sorted in descending order

Constraints
3 < N < 2⁶⁴
