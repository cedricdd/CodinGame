Goal
Your objective is to send the fastest champion to solve the maze.
The champions have different capabilities and speed.
- The WARRIOR has no special capability but he is the faster and he can cross a cell in 2 seconds !
- The DWARF can break wall if the wall thickness is only 1 cell. He needs 3 seconds to cross a cell.
- The ELF can do diagonal moves. Because he can make a lot of different moves he must think of it twice and it will cost 4 seconds to decide which cell to go first.
- The MAGE can fly straightforward until the next direction change. Because of the long wizard robe, he moves very slowly and each cell marked will cost 5 seconds.

Some examples:

score: 14 (7 steps x 2 seconds)


With DWARF:
Input      Output
#######    #######
#...#.#    #...#.#
>.#.#.>    >>>>>>>
#.#...#    #.#...#
#######    #######
score: 21 (7 steps x 3 seconds)


With ELF:
Input      Output
#######    #######
#.....>    #...>>>
#.#.###    #.#o###
>..#..#    >>o#..#
#######    #######
score: 28 (7 steps x 4 seconds)


With MAGE:
Input      Output
#######    #######
#.....>    #....>>
#####.#    #####.#
>.....#    >....^#
#######    #######
score: 20 (4 x 5 seconds)

Input
Line 1: An integer W for the width of the maze
Line 1: An integer H for the height of the maze
Next H lines: Details for the maze

Output
You must print in uppercase, the champion with his score
You must print the complete maze with the path done by the champion. 
The path is written with the following arrows (<, >, v, ^) except for diagonal moves with the elf where you must print o before the diagonal move.

Constraints
- All champions can complete all the mazes.
- There is always only one best choice (no draw between two champions)
- width < 25
- height < 25
- entry is given by an arrow (<, >, v, ^) that is going inside the maze.
- exit is given by an arrow (<, >, v, ^) that is going outside the maze.
- empty cell is showing with .
- wall is showing with #
- the borders of the maze can't be broken by the dwarf.
