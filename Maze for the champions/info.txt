Goal
Your objective is to send the fastest champion to solve the maze.
The champions have different capabilities and speed.
- The WARRIOR has no special capability but he is the fastest and he can cross a cell in 2 seconds !
- The DWARF can break wall if the wall thickness is only 1 cell. He needs 3 seconds to cross a cell.
- The ELF can do diagonal moves. Because he can make a lot of different moves he must think of it twice and it will cost 4 seconds to decide which cell to go first.
- The MAGE can fly straight forward as many cells as he wants without being able to cross a wall. Because of the long wizard robe, he moves very slowly and each cell marked will cost 5 seconds.

Rules:
- entry is given by an arrow (<, >, v, ^) that is going inside the maze.
- exit is given by an arrow (<, >, v, ^) that is going outside the maze.
- empty cell is shown with .
- wall is shown with #
- the borders of the maze can't be broken by the dwarf.
- First step and last step are mandatory and can't be changed. Even for the mage who needs to land on the end point.

Line 1: An integer W for the width of the maze
Line 2: An integer H for the height of the maze
Next H lines: Details for the maze

Output
Line 1: The champion and his score, separated with a space
Next H lines: The complete maze with the path done by the champion. The path is represented using the arrows denoting the directions (<, >, v, ^) except for the elf's diagonal move which is denoted with o.
