Goal

On each line, there are two people, who together form a romantic couple.
They want to combine their individual names together to create their own Couple-Name -- just for fun and to make it easier for the Tabloids to write about them.

Example:
Ben + Jennifer = Bennifer
Brad + Angelina = Brangelina
Heidi + Spencer = Speidi

Given the following rules, print out options for that couple:

RULES:
• There must be at least 1 shared letter. In other words, there must be at least 1 letter common to both names.
• Must include the most shared letters as possible. For example, if there is a Couple-Name that shares 2 letters, don't show any that include less than 2 shared letters.
• Must not be shorter than the shortest person-name.
• No spelling changes other than “sub-stringing”
• Where there are multiple options, list them alphabetically on the same line separated by spaces.
• If no options, print NONE

Input
Line 1: An integer n, denoting the number of couples
Line 2: n couples, in the format of name1 (which is always a single word) and name2 (which is always a single word) 
and then sometimes a last name or other extra information just as FYI, in case you need it for your Tabloid story.
(name1 and name2 -- which are always the 1st word and 3rd word in the input string -- is all you will use to make the Couple-Name)

Output
n lines: Couple-Names for each couple: name1 plus name2 = alphabetized list of Couple-Names, in the format described above

Constraints
Names do not have anything other than letters. In Couple-Names, only the first letter is capitalized
