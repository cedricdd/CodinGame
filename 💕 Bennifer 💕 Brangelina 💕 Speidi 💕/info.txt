Goal

When two famous people get together and form a romantic couple, the Tabloids love to write about them and their adventures.

The reporters combine (smoosh) their two individual names together to create a Couple-Name -- just for fun and to make it easier to write about them.
Example:
Ben + Jennifer = Bennifer
Brad + Angelina = Brangelina
Heidi + Spencer = Speidi

Given the following rules, print out options for each couple.

RULES:
• The overall process is: Smoosh a left-substring (or whole name) of one person together with a right-substring (or whole name) of the other person, in such 
a way that there is at least 1 Overlapping letter (aka shared letter, aka common letter).
• Must contain at least one letter from each person, that isn't part of the Overlapping-letters.
• Must include the most Overlapping-letters as possible. For example, if there is a Couple-Name that has 2 Overlapping-letters, don't show others that
include less than 2 Overlapping-letters.
• Comparisons are case-insensitive.
• No spelling changes other than “sub-stringing”
• Must not be shorter than the shortest person-name.
• A Couple-Name has only the first letter capitalized, regardless of the individual's names.
• A Couple-Name cannot be the same as either of the individual's name because that's just silly
• Where there are multiple options, list them alphabetically on the same line separated by spaces.
• If no options, print NONE

Sorry I can't help more, but Keanu Reeves and I are headed out on some excellent "Lisanu" adventures, 
and later Eddie Vedder and I ("Eddisa") will be spotted vacationing on a yacht together.

Input
Line 1: An integer n, denoting the number of couples
Line 2: n couples, in the format of name1 (which is always a single word) and name2 (which is always a single word) and then sometimes a last name or other
extra information just as FYI, in case you need it for your Tabloid story.
(name1 and name2 -- which are ALWAYS the 1st word and 3rd word in the input string -- is all you use to make the Couple-Name)

Output
n lines: Couple-Names for each couple: name1 plus name2 = alphabetized list of Couple-Names separated by spaces

Constraints
Names do not have anything other than letters.
