Goal
You have to convert an English length unit into another one.
You are given the relations needed to calculate some unit into some other unit.

Note: You might know that 1 nautic mile = 6080 feet and not 6000 feet. For the purpose of this puzzle, we removed this contradiction.

Input
Line 1: unit 1 in unit 2
Line 2: The number n of relations below
Next n lines: number unit x = number unit y

Output
number unit 1 = number unit 2

Constraints
The numbers in the relations are integers, not always ones on the left, the smallest numbers possible.
