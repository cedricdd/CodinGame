Goal
You are a manufacturer and installer of Floor-Tiles.

The beauty of Tiles comes from their symmetry, in that the quadrants of a Tile are mirror/reflections of each other.

So, when you get an order for a Tile, only the pattern of the top left quadrant (plus a little more, so you can see the center characters) are the input. 
Graphically explained here:
☑☑☑☐☐
☑☑☑☐☐
☑☑☑☐☐
☐☐☐☐☐
☐☐☐☐☐

From that limited input, your task is to:
Create a full Tile
And display a 2x2 floor (i.e., a floor consisting of 4 of those Tiles)

DETAILS:
➤ Each Tile is a square; the input therefore is also a square
➤ The input square shows the top left character of the full Tile, all the way to the middle character of the full Tile
➤ The input has a side-length of N; therefore the full Tile has a side-length of 2N-1
➤ The full floor needs a grout border, and grout separating the individual Tiles. Grout is represented by - on top/bottom, | on sides, and + on corners

Flip/Mirror patterns:
Generally, a character appearing in the first quadrant just replicates in the other quadrants.

However, for these special characters, you will need to sometimes print the opposite-mate of it:
• () {} [] <> If any of these are on the left side, then show its opposite-mate on the right side
• ^v AV wm WM un If any of these are on the top half, then show its opposite-mate on the bottom half
• /\ If either of these is on the top left quadrant, then show its opposite-mate on the two adjacent quadrants
(The opposite-mate is the one beside it in the character-pair as shown)

Input
Line 1: An integer N, denoting the number of rows of input
N lines: row of Tile pattern

Output
The entire floor

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 7
