Goal
You know the number of coins (numCoins) and you know the total value of those coins (moneyAmt).

Figure out:
‣ how many different combinations of coins (diffCoinCombos) that there could be, and
‣ the range of the total weights of them: i.e., from minTotalWeight to maxTotalWeight
(all weights are in grams)

Example:
5 coins $0.86 has 2 diffCoinCombos, namely:
‣ 3 quarters, 1 dime, 1 penny -- which together weigh 21.778 grams
‣ 1 half-dollar, 1 quarter, 2 nickels, 1 penny -- which together weigh 29.510 grams
So the answer would be 2 options from 21.778 g to 29.510 g

Other possibilities:
‣ If there is only ONE diffCoinCombos, then just print out that weight (onlyTotalWeight), in the format shown in Output section
‣ If there are NONE diffCoinCombos, just print out Impossible


Coin info you will need:
Name of coin, value of it, weight of it (in grams)
"penny 1 2.500"
"nickel 5 5.000"
"dime 10 2.268"
"quarter 25 5.670"
"half-dollar 50 11.340"

Input
Line 1: An integer (N), stating how many lines to follow
next N Lines: A string idCoinsMoneyAmt, consisting of:
an id, which is an integer in parentheses
the number of coins (numCoins)
the word coins
moneyAmount including $
(Everything separated by a space)

Output
N Lines: Each consisting of one of the following:
id (from input) diffCoinCombos options from minTotalWeight g to maxTotalWeight g
~or~
id (from input) 1 option of onlyTotalWeight g
~or~
id (from input) Impossible

(Everything separated by a space)

Show all weights to 3 decimal places

Constraints
$0.07 ≤ moneyAmount ≤ $25.00
3 ≤ numCoins ≤ 200
