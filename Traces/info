Goal
You are given an integer t for the number of tests. Each test is a space separated string containing three substrings: base, target, and fixed.

For each test, print true if you can go from base to target by swapping, any amount of times, adjacent letters that are not in the fixed string, or false if you cannot.

Input
Line 1 : An integer t, the number of tests.
Next t lines: A space separated string test containing three substrings: base, target, and fixed.

Output
t lines, each containing the answer true or false to the corresponding test.

Constraints
Every character of base, target and fixed is a lowercase letter of the alphabet.
There are no duplicate characters in fixed
Every character in fixed appears at least once in base and once in target
0 < len(test) < 256
