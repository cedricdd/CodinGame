Goal
Given two teams of champions, my_team on the left and opponents on the right, with list of hits performed by each of them.
Output the order of champions in my_team to win the fight with fewer number of hits.

Rules:
- Each team has a predetermined sequence of attacks.
- The order of champions in my_team is determined by you, while the order in opponents is given as input.
- The champions in each team engage in a 1-to-1 fight until one of them is dead (life <= 0).
- The next champion (if any) from the team whose champion is defeated steps in to continue the fight, using the remaining sequence of attacks.
- All champions start with rage = 0
- When a champion is hit, his/her rage increases by one.
- When a champion uses special attack, his/her rage restarts at 0.
- The fight stops when all fighters in a team are dead.

In the input, each hit is preceded by the direction of the attack:
- > means champion in my_team hits champion in opponents.
- < means champion in opponents hits champion in my_team.
