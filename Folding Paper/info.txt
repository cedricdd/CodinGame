Goal
A sheet of paper is folded several times. The goal is to determine how many layers of paper are visible from one side of the obtained folding.

Folding motions are:
R for Right: take the right side and fold it on the left side.
L for Left: take the left side and fold it on the right side.
U for Up: take the high side and fold it on the low side.
D for Down: take the low side and fold it on the high side.

Input
Line 1: a fold string order: several letters R, L, U and D with no space in-between
Line 2: side: a single character R, L, U or D

Output
n: the number of layers of paper visible from side

Constraints
2 characters ≤ length of order ≤ 8 characters
(Try to fold a sheet more than 6 times!)
