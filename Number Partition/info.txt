Goal
In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. 
Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.

Write a program outputting all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order.
Each partition satisfies:
a1 + a2 + ... + ak = n
a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ ak

Output all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order. The integers in each partition should be space-separated.

Input
an integer n.

Output
Several lines: one partition per line

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 9
