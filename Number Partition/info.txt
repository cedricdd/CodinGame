Goal
In number theory and combinatorics, an integer partition of a positive integer n is a way of expressing n as a sum of positive integers. 
Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.

Write a program outputting all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order. Each partition must satisfy the following conditions:

a1 + a2 + ... + ak = n
a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ ak > 0

Output all integer partitions of n in reverse lexicographic order. The integers within each partition should be separated by spaces.

Input
An integer n.

Output
Multiple lines: each containing one partition.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 13
