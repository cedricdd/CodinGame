Goal
A near-palindrome is a word one letter away from being a palindrome, be it by replacement, addition or removal.

Input
Line 1: the number of words N
Next N lines: a word

Output
A single line of zeroes and ones.
For each word in the input, in order, output 1 if the word is a near-palindrome and 0 otherwise.

Constraints
N < 1000
word length < 10000

Words are solely lowercase alphabetic ASCII characters.
This puzzle Really Has Nothing To Do with the Hypersonic challenge.
