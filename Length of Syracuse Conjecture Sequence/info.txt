Goal
The Syracuse Conjecture concerns a sequence of integers defined as follows:

- start with any positive integer n. 
- Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
   * if the previous term is even
        the next term is one half the previous term. 
   * If the previous term is odd
        the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.


The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

For example, given the input 22, the following sequence is constructed: 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of terms in the sequence, including the terminating 1. 
For a given n, this is called the cycle-length of n.

In the example above, the cycle-length of 22 is 16.

For any two numbers A and B you are to determine the maximum cycle-length over all numbers between them.

Input
Line 1: An Integer N the number of ranges to compute.
N next lines: Two integers A and B respectively the lower and upper bound of the range.

Output
N lines: i cycle_length the lowest integer that leads to the longest cycle-length, and the cycle length itself.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ A ≤ i ≤ B ≤ 100000
You can assume that no operation overflows a 32-bit integer
