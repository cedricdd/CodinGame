Goal
Prime twins are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2. For example, (11, 13) and (17, 19) are pairs of prime twins. Your task is to write a program that takes an integer 𝑛 as input and find the first pair of prime twins where both numbers are greater than 𝑛.

Input
an integer number 𝑛

Output
two integers separated by a space, for the first pair of prime twins both of which are greater than 𝑛

Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100,000
