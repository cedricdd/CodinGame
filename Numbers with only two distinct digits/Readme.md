# Puzzle
**Numbers with only two distinct digits** https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/130926c04bc8346fd292fbb7a6fd44bcaa7450

Goal
Given a strictly positive integer n and the two non 0 digits a and b (one is odd, the other is even), find the positive integer that has n digits (using only a or b) and that is divisible by 2^n .

There is always a unique integer satisfying all the conditions (you can try to prove it as an exercise).

# Input
* Line 1: A strictly positive integer n.
* Line 2: Two digits a and b separated by a space.

# Output
* Line 1: The number you found

# Constraints
* 0 < n ≤ 500
* 0 < a, b < 10
* a and b have different parity.
