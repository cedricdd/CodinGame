Goal
Context:
五 and 七, two brilliant young students in middle school, have just finished creating their own secret language during the holidays. Proud of their creation, they speak confidently, convinced that no one will ever be able to decipher their messages.

Encryption principles:
• i denotes the integer between a pair of prime twins. For example, between 5 and 7, i = 6.
• n represents the secret key agreed upon by 五 and 七.

Transformation rules:
A is transformed into n + n. For subsequent letters like B and beyond, n is added to the integer located between the closest pair of prime twins that is strictly greater than the previous value. For example, if the previous value was i, the search for the next pair of twins starts from i + 1.

Example:
If n = 3, A would be 3 + 3 = 6. For B, the search for prime twins starts strictly above 6, and the closest twins could be 11 and 13, so i = 12 and B = 3 + 12 = 15. For C, starting strictly above 15, the next twins might be 17 and 19, so i = 18 and C = 3 + 18 = 21.

Output format:
The resulting integers are then converted to hexadecimal in upper case, separated by G or GG for space. For example, ABC is transformed into 6, 15, 21, which is then converted to 6GFG15.

Objective:
Develop code to decode or encode the secret language of 五 and 七.

Input
Line 1: string operator ENCODE/DECODE
Line 2: integer n Secret key agreed upon by 五 and 七
Line 3: string secret message

Output
DECODE/ENCODE upper case message / "ERROR !!"

Constraints
2 <= n <= 5*10⁶
message contains only letters and spaces
message must be upper case
