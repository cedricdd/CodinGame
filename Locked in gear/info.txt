Goal
A number of gears are placed on a grid. The first gear is driven in a clockwise direction. Your goal is to determine the turning direction of the last gear.

Input
Line 1: an integer N corresponding to the number of gears (at least 2)
Next N lines: the properties of the gears, given as
- the coordinates of center of the gear, given by two integers x and y
- the radius of the gear, given by an integer r

Output
A single line, stating the direction of the last gear from the input. The direction can be one of the following:
- CW for a clockwise movement,
- CCW for a counterclockwise movement,
- NOT MOVING if the gear doesn't move at all.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ x ≤ 1000
0 ≤ y ≤ 1000
1 ≤ r ≤ 1000
The gears do not overlap.
