 Goal
You are a train passenger and you want to know the shortest path you can take between two stations. 
Unfortunately, there is no direct path between these two stations. So, you need to travel station to station to arrive at your destination. 
You want to find the shortest path you can take. The shortest path is the path that travels through the smallest number of stations.
There will always be a path from start to end.

Input
Line 1: A string start representing the start station.
Line 2: A string end representing the end station.
Line 3: An integer n representing the number of links between all stations.
Next n lines: A string link formatted as: "station1 station2" saying that a direct path exists between station1 and station2. This path is bidirectional.

Output
Line 1: A string that represents the smallest path between the start and the end formatted as: "A > B > C > D" where A is start and D is end.

Constraints
0 < n < 30
