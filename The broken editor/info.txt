Goal
Your favourite code editor broke, it can't display what you're typing anymore!
Replace the part that handles the keyboard inputs and build the output yourself!

All typed_keys can be either a character, a keyboard arrow (left / right) represented by < and > or a backspace represented by the minus sign -
< moves the editor's cursor to the left
> moves the editor's cursor to the right
- removes one character on the left side of the cursor's position (backspace behaviour)
Keep in mind that a cursor has boundaries: from the left of the first character to the right of the last one

Example 1:
You typed an extra L in Helllo World and removed it with a backspace:

Input: Helll-o World
Output: Hello World


Example 2:
While typing too fast, you skipped the e. You pressed left arrow twice, typed e then went back to the right and typed the rest ("o World")

Input: Hll<<e>>o World
Output: Hello World


Input
Line 1: typed_keys A string representing all the pressed keys (characters/arrows/backspaces)

Output
Line 1: The text to display in the editor's window

Constraints
1 ≤ length of typed_keys ≤ 80
