Goal
The goal is really simple. Given a number n, count how many 1s are used to write all binary integers from 0 to n (inclusive)

For example, n = 5
0....000...0
1....001...1
2....010...1
3....011...2
4....100...1
5....101...2

Total : 1+1+2+1+2 = 7

Input
Single line: An integer n

Output
Single line: Number of 1s used to write all binary integers from 0 to n (inclusive)

Constraints
n < 2^28
Result < 2^32
