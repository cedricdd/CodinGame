Goal
We have a snail race we will have to determine the winner !
- The number of snails is given in the variable numberSnails.
- Each snail has a speed given in the variable speedSnail
- You have a map of the game with a height of mapHeight and a width of mapWidth.

On the map we have:
number that represents a snail from 1 to numberSnails
* which represents a place where the snail can go
# which represents the destination

Snails can go right, left, up, down. Snails cannot go diagonally.
The snail takes the path closest to it.


Input
Line 1: An integer numberSnails for the number of snails.
Next numberSnails lines: An integer speedSnail for the speed of a snail.
Next line: An integer mapHeight which is the height of the map.
Next line: An integer mapWidth which is the width of the map.
Next mapHeight lines: A string ROW for one line of the map.

Output
A number that represents the winner of the race

Constraints
2 ≤ numberSnails ≤ 6
0 ≤ speedSnail ≤ 6
2 ≤ mapHeight ≤ 6
5 ≤ mapWidth ≤ 9
