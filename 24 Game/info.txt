Info/Rules
The 24 puzzle is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. 
For example, for the numbers 4, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is (7-8/8)*4 = 24 - Wikipedia

You are given 4 integers, each ranging from 0-13. Determine whether it is possible to achieve the number 24 
using only parenthesis, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while including every single given integer in your calculations.

You can make 24 from 1, 2, 3, and 4
With 1*2*3*4

You can make 24 from 3, 3, 8, and 8
With 8/(3-(8/3))

You can make 24 from 5, 5, 5, and 5
With (5*5)-(5/5)

You can't make 24 from 1, 1, 1, and 1

You can't make 24 from 0, 1, 4, and 9

Input
Lines 1-4: An integer N

Output
Line 1: Whether or not it is possible to achieve 24 as a result of the 4 integers using the rules above, "true" if possible and "false" if not.

Constraints
