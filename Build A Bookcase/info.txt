Goal
You are building a bookcase of a certain height and width, with a certain numberOfShelves:
• Except for the decorative top, you will use only the underline (_) and pipe (|) characters (and of course spaces) to do this.
• Divide the bookcase into as evenly distributed shelf-spaces as possible.
• If some have to be larger, put those below the others so they can hold the bigger heavier books.

NOTES:
• The decorative top of the bookcase (which is included in the height measurement) does not count as a shelf.
• The bottom of the bookcase does count as a shelf.
• For simplicity, assume a shelf itself doesn't take up any space.

The decorative top consists of / on the left side and \ on the right side, and a single ^ in the middle if needed.

Input
Line 1: integer height
Line 2: integer width
Line 3: integer numberOfShelves

Output
height lines, drawing the bookcase

Constraints
height,width ≥ 3
numberOfShelves ≥ 2
height > numberOfShelves
