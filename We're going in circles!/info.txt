Goal
There is a w by h grid of arrows represented by: "^", ">", "v", "<". Empty cells are represented by periods: ".".

A loop of arrows is a set of arrows that loop back on themselves when moving from one arrow to the closest arrow in the direction that it points. 
If an arrow points outside the grid, it is not part of a loop.

The goal is to count the number_of_loops in the grid.

Input
line 1: w and h separated by a space (width and height, respectively).
The next h lines: The grid of arrows and empty cells.

Output
The number_of_loops in the grid.

Constraints
0 < w, h <= 20
The grid only contains the characters: ^>v<.
