Goal
Often times, when confronted with a large line of urinals, you must find the open urinal that is furthest away from all other occupied urinals in order 
to minimize awkwardness. (See https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/09/02/urinal-protocol-vulnerability/ for inspiration)

Write a program that accepts information about a line of urinals and provides the correct urinal index to use.

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of urinals in the bathroom.
Line 2: A string B containing N characters of either a U for unoccupied or a ! for occupied.

Output
Line 1: The index of the unoccupied urinal that is furthest away from any occupied urinals. 
(If two unoccupied urinals are equally isolated, print the index of the leftmost one)

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 100
B will contain at least one U and one !
