# Puzzle
**Gauss and the Stolen Numbers** https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1370971b6722302de24b0ce39367b2e1a13800

# Goal
You are young Gauss, and your teacher wrote the natural numbers from 1 to N on the board.  
When the class went out for lunch, two numbers mysteriously disappeared!

All that remains are: 
* the sum of the remaining natural numbers
* the sum of their squares

Your task is to find the two missing natural numbers.

# Input
* Line 1: An integer N representing the largest natural number written on the board.
* Line 2: An integer S — the sum of the remaining natural numbers.
* Line 3: An integer Q — the sum of squares of the remaining natural numbers.

# Output
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers — the missing natural numbers, in ascending order.

# Constraints
* 2 ≤ N ≤ 1 000 000
* All given values fit within 64-bit signed integers.
