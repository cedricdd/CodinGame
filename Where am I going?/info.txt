Goal
Your program must describe the path through a field.

The start is always from outside the field at the top left, heading right.

The output will be the number of steps to move.
Followed by R to turn right or L to turn left if the path has not yet ended.
This is repeated until the path ends. The path may end in the middle of the field or at the edge.

Note: the path will be such that there is only one solution.

Input
Line 1: An integer h for the number of lines
Line 2: An integer w for the length of each line
Next h lines: A string of length w. # for the path and . for the field that is not the path

Output
Line 1: A string for the path.

Constraints
1 ≤ h ≤ 30
3 ≤ w ≤ 30
