Goal
You should print out a spiral of numbers from 1 to n^2 or vice versa starting from the defined corner and in clockwise or counter-clockwise order with tabulation (\t) as separator.

For descending order the corner in input marks the place where the n^2 should be

Input
Line 1: An integer n for the spiral size
Line 2: two space-separated letters v h to mark the starting point ( v is 't' for top or 'b' for bottom, h is 'l' for left or 'r' for right)
Line 3: two space-separated values o and d to mark order of numbers and direction, where o is '+' for ascending order of numbers or '-' for descending, and d is 'c' for clockwise and 'cc' for counter-clockwise order

Output
n lines: the tab-separated spiral of numbers

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10
