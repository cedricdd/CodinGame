# Puzzle
**Create "Turn Here" Signs** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/create-turn-here-signs

# Goal
Secretary of Transportation Pete has asked you to program electronic signs to communicate to drivers that they need to turn left or turn right.

Pete wants lots of options for the signs, so the input is:  
* direction -- which is either left or right
* howManyArrows
* heightOfArrows
* strokeThicknessOfArrows
* spacingBetweenArrows
* additionalIndentOfEachLine -- this will determine if the shape of the arrows is subtle or more pointy

However, Pete is also a minimalist, so all that input will be in a single string of data.

Note:  
* Left turn signs will consist of < and spaces only
* Right turn signs will consist of > and spaces only

# Input
* Line 1: string allInput, that is composed of direction howManyArrows heightOfArrows strokeThicknessOfArrows spacingBetweenArrows additionalIndentOfEachLine

# Output
* heightOfArrows lines: the Turn Here sign

# Constraints
* The input string allInput is a single word followed by 5 integers.
* All are separated by a single space.
* All integers are > 0

heightOfArrows is an odd number, â‰¥ 5
