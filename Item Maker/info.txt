Goal
You are programming a new game, but you have to create an interface for your items. Unfortunately, the amount of data is high, and you have to write a program to automate it.

Create an ASCII art of the data to add it to the game later

Input
Line 1: A string data the data to convert into an item

Output
The ASCII art of the item ready to be added to the game

Constraints
data always have a name, a rarity, and at least 1 attribute.
The frame of the item depends on his rarity. I let you guess what they are :D

data = itemName,itemRarity,attribute1:value,attribute2:value...
5 <= length of itemName <= 100
itemRarity is always Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary
