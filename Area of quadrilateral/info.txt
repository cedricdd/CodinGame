Goal
Given the (x, y) coordinates of four points on a Cartesian plane (in no particular order) that form a quadrilateral where each internal angle is smaller than 180 degrees, find the area of the quadrilateral, rounded down.

Input
Lines 1 to 4: Each line contains two space-separated integers x and y for the coordinates of one point of the quadrilateral.

Output
The area of the quadrilateral.

Constraints
-600 < x, y < 600
