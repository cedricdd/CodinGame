Goal
You must determine the partition number for a given integer n. The partition number p(n) represents the number of different ways n can be expressed as a sum of positive integers, irrespective of the order of addends.

Input
Line 1: An integer T representing the number of test cases.
Next T lines: An integer n for which you need to find the partition number.

Output
T lines: For each test case, an integer representing the partition number p(n).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 15
0 ≤ n ≤ 100
