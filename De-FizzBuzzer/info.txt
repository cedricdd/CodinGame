Goal
We have a mysterious machine, the FizzBuzzer, that implements an advanced version of FizzBuzz.

The FizzBuzzer receives a positive integer, and outputs a single string by joining the substrings produced by the rules below and in that order:
- produce Fizz for each time the digit 3 appears in the integer;
- produce Fizz for each time the integer can be divided by 3;
- produce Buzz for each time the digit 5 appears in the integer;
- produce Buzz for each time the integer can be divided by 5;
- if no Fizz or Buzz has been produced so far, produce the original integer as the substring.

Your task is to invert the behaviour of the FizzBuzzer. You will receive some strings, and for each string you should determine the smallest positive integer (up to 1000 inclusive), if any, that would produce that string when fed to the FizzBuzzer.

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of strings.
Next N lines: On each line, a string that may have been produced by the FizzBuzzer.

Output
N lines: The smallest positive integer (up to 1000 inclusive) that would produce the given string, or the string ERROR if no such integer exists.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
length of each string ≤ 100
1 ≤ each output integer ≤ 1000
