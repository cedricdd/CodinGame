# Puzzle
**Reverse FizzBuzz** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/reverse-fizzbuzz

# Goal
FizzBuzz is a problem that can be described with following rules:  
For given f b n integers, in range from 1 to n inclusive, output:  
* for multiples of f print Fizz
* for multiples of b print Buzz
* for multiples of f and b print FizzBuzz
* for other cases print the number

Given integer n and n lines of FizzBuzz output, find original f and b values.

# Input
* Line 1: An integer n for the FizzBuzz lines number.
* Next n lines: String containing FizzBuzz output line.
* Note that this line won't necessary start from 1.

# Output
* Two space-separated Fizz and Buzz multiplier integers f and b.

# Constraints
* 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
* 1 ≤ f, b < 60
