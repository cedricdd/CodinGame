There are only 3 buttons on a pinball machine to input your initials Left - Right - Player.

With the Left orRight button you can navigate through a list of characters which are displayed on the LCD screen from A to Z, space and <.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ < (only 28 choices)
If you press R when you have reached < you move to A
If you press L when you have reached A you move to <

At the beginning the character A is highlighted.
If you press the Player button then the highlighted character is chosen.

You can delete the last character if you move to < and press button P (except if it's the 3rd character because on a pinball machine you can never amend the last character).

Once all 3 characters have been chosen, the initials are finalised and any further button presses are ignored.

If P is pressed when character is < and your initials are empty then nothing happens.

Input sequence :
A string sequence can contain the letter P or the letter R or L followed by a positive integer to indicate how many characters to move.

Demo :

Let us consider the following sequence : PR2PL1P

The first character A is highlighted
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <
You press the button P then the character A is selected.
Your initals are : A

You press the Right button twice (R2) then the character C is highlighted.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <
You press the button P then the character C is selected.
Your initals are : AC

You press the Left button once (L1) then the character B is highlighted.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <
You press the button P then the character B is selected.
Your initals are : ACB

At the end of this sequence your initials are ACB and the pinball machine shows the High-Score table.

Input
sequence : a string with all the buttons pressed by the player

Output
initials : The player's High-Score initials (3 letters)

Constraints
Left and Right numbers are between 1 and 99

All sequences are valid and produce 3-characters initials (including a space character)
