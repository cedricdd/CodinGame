# Puzzle
**Crack the Trio Code** https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1195419439be626d7acb265aa9a54707b75095

# Goal
There are three positive integers, called triads. By selecting 1 to 3 of these numbers (with repetitions allowed) and summing them, you obtain what is known as triad sums. You are given a sorted subset L of triad sums. Your task is to determine the original triads.  
- If there is only one possible set of triads, output them in ascending order (comma-separated).
- If there are multiple possible sets, output many.
- If no valid set exists, output none.
  
# Input
* Line 1: A comma-separated list of integers representing a sorted subset of triad sums (with no duplicates).

# Output
* Line 1: The answer as specified in the statement.

# Constraints
* max(L) â‰¤ 120
