Goal
The aim of this puzzle is to simulate the impact of the shock wave of bombs on a square grid. 
The grid initially contains cells labeled 0 along with several bombs of type A, H, or B. 
Display the greatest intensity of shockwaves felt at each cell after the bombs explode.

The three bombs have different explosion patterns. Consider the following generic configuration, 
where the X will be replaced by the different types of bombs. Note that for each bomb, the bomb's location is not replaced by a number.
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
0000X0000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000

For the A-bomb:
000000000
011111110
012222210
012333210
0123A3210
012333210
012222210
011111110
000000000

For the H-bomb:
000000000
055555550
055555550
055555550
0555H5550
055555550
055555550
055555550
000000000

For the B-bomb:
000000000
000010000
000020000
000030000
0123B3210
000030000
000020000
000010000
000000000
Unlike the other bombs, the B-bomb will not explode unless it is within the shockwave of another exploding bomb.

Input
¤ First line: An integer N representing the size of the square grid
¤ The following N lines: Strings representing each line of the grid

Output
¤ N lines: Strings representing each line of the grid after the bombs explode. If two effects from two different bombs are felt on a square,
the stronger effect is recorded on the square

Constraints
¤ 1 ≤ N ≤ 25
¤ The place may already have felt the effect of other bombs before the grid bombs exploded. 
In this case the number of the cell will be different from 0 as soon as the grid is given
¤ There are only three types of bomb: A, B, H
¤ There may be no explosion
