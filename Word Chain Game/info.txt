Goal
Alice and Bob play a word chain game. In this game, the two players take alternating turns, with Alice going first.

The players have a word list consisting of N words. All words in the word list are distinct.

In each player's turn, the player chooses a word from the word list that satisfies the following two conditions:
- The word has not been chosen before by either player.
- If it's not the first turn of the game, the first character of the chosen word must be the same as the last character of the previous word.

If a player is unable to choose a word satisfying the above conditions, that player loses and the other player wins.

Determine who wins, if both players play optimally.

Input
Line 1: An integer N: the number of words in the word list.
Next N lines: A single string - a word in the word list.

Output
Print Alice or Bob, the winner of the game.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 16
The words in the word list are at most 12 letters long.
The words in the word list are all distinct.
