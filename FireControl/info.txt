Goal
You need to cut down some trees in a forest fire to stop the fire from spreading. 
Write code to help you determine the least amount of trees to cut to contain the fire.

The size of the forest is a 6 by 6 grid.
Fire can spread sideways as well as diagonally.
To stop the fire, you need to remove two layers of trees.

# Tree

o Empty space
* Fire

If there are no trees that can be saved by blocking the fire, output: 'JUST RUN'.
if there is no fire, output: 'RELAX'.
