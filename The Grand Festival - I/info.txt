The Problem:

Given the prize-money for each tournament, and the maximum consecutive days Merry and Pippin can play without break, 
output the maximum prize money they can win.

Rules:
There are N tournaments in all, held from day 1 to day N.
Merry and Pippin can play at most R consecutive tournaments before they have to rest.
The prize money for all the tournaments will be given to you.
You need to display the maximum total prize money.

Example:
Let there be 10 tournaments
Let Merry and Pippin be able to play 4 days consecutive
Let the prize moneys be 13, 2, 15, 17, 19, 33, 2, 2, 2, 2.
So, Merry and Pippin will play on days 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 >6 > 8 > 9 > 10
Thus, the maximum prize money will be 103
