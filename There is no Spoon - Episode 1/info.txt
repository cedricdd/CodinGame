 The Goal
The game is played on a rectangular grid with a given size. Some cells contain power nodes. The rest of the cells are empty.

The goal is to find, when they exist, the horizontal and vertical neighbors of each node.
  Rules
To do this, you must find each (x1,y1) coordinates containing a node, and display the (x2,y2) coordinates of the next node to the right, and the (x3,y3) coordinates of the next node to the bottom within the grid.

If a neighbor does not exist, you must output the coordinates -1 -1 instead of (x2,y2) and/or (x3,y3).

You lose if:

    You give an incorrect neighbor for a node.
    You give the neighbors for an empty cell.
    You compute the same node twice.
    You forget to compute the neighbors of a node.


Initialization input

Line 1: one integer width for the number of cells along the x axis.

Line 2: one integer height for the number of cells along the y axis.

Next height lines: A string  line  containing  width  characters. A dot . represents an empty cell. A zero 0 represents a cell containing a node.

Output for one game turn
One line per node. Six integers on each line:   x1  y1  x2  y2  x3  y3

Where:

    (x1,y1) the coordinates of a node
    (x2,y2) the coordinates of the closest neighbor on the right of the node
    (x3,y3) the coordinates of the closest bottom neighbor

If there is no neighbor, the coordinates should be -1 -1.

Constraints
0 < width ≤ 30
0 < height ≤ 30
0 ≤ x1 < width
0 ≤ y1 < height
-1 ≤ x2, x3 < width
-1 ≤ y2, y3 < height
Alloted response time to first output line ≤ 1s.
Response time between two output lines ≤ 100ms
