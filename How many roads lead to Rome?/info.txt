Goal
Someone just told you all roads lead to Rome.
As a matter of fact, this is not true.
In order to restore scientific truth, you must write a program that counts the actual number of paths from Paris to Rome, where cities are visited at most once.
To start with, you are given a collection of all paths that directly connect two individual cities and where each city is defined by a number from 1 to 100. 
Paris has label 1, and Rome has label 100.
One may use paths both ways.

Let us illustrate the problem with a simple example:
you are given 5 paths:

1 50
50 100
25 50
75 25
100 75

So, we have 5 cities:
- 1 (Paris)
- 25
- 50
- 75
- 100 (Rome)

There are 2 roads from Paris to Rome:
1 -> 50 -> 100

1 -> 50 -> 25 -> 75 -> 100
Input
Line 1: An integer N corresponding to the total number of paths
N next lines: Two integers A and B corresponding to the two cities the path connects.

Output
The number of roads from Paris to Rome

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ A,B ≤ 100
