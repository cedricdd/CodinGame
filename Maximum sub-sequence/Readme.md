# Puzzle
**Maximum sub-sequence** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/maximum-sub-sequence

# Goal
Given a list of N random integers Ik, you must return the maximum-length incrementing sequence contained in this list (for each Ik in the sequence, Ik=I(k-1)+1).  
The incrementing sequence must be ordered, but need not be adjacent in the given sequence.  

In case of multiple maximum-length sequences, return the one with the lowest starting integer.

# Input
* Line 1: a single integer N.
* Line 2: a list of N integers Ik separated by space.

# Output
* Line 1: a list of integers separated by space.

# Constraints
* -10^7 <= Ik <= 10^7
* 0 < N < 1500
