Goal
You must determine the winner of a hand in Texas Holdem Poker. Output the winning player, their hand type and the five winning card values.

CARDS
A card is represented by two characters, one for the value and one for the suit.
• values (descending order): A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
• suits (no order): C, D, H, S

HANDS
A player's hand is the best 5 card-card combination from the 7 card combination of their own 2 hole cards with the 5 community cards. 
A hand is one of the following types, in descending order of value:
• STRAIGHT_FLUSH - 5 consecutive cards of the same suit
• FOUR_OF_A_KIND - 4 cards of matching values and 1 kicker*
• FULL_HOUSE - 3 cards of matching values, and 2 of a different matching value
• FLUSH - 5 non-consecutive cards, all the same suit
• STRAIGHT - 5 consecutive cards
• THREE_OF_A_KIND - 3 cards of matching values and 2 kickers*
• TWO_PAIR - 2 cards of a matching value, 2 of a different matching value and 1 kicker*
• PAIR - 2 cards of matching values and 3 kickers*, e.g. 66T42
• HIGH_CARD - The absence of any better hand means that the highest value card counts with 4 kickers*, e.g. Q7432

* = A kicker is a leftover card which does not contribute to determining the type of a hand, but is used to break ties. 
The highest kicker is considered first, then the next, and so on. Only if none of the kickers are larger might a hand be considered a DRAW. 
For convenience, we call cards in the 5 card combination that are not kicker cards, "non-kickers".

Note that there's no need to implement a special case for a royal flush.

DETERMINING WINNING HANDS
A higher HandType beats all lower hand types. If the HandType is the same:
• Place cards in the order given below
• Iterate each card in turn, e.g. 1st card Player 1 vs 1st card player 2
• If one value is higher then that player is the winner, else continue to the next card
• If no such win is found, the hand is a DRAW

ORDERING CARDS
Cards are ordered by descending non-kicker values, followed by descending kicker values. In case of a FULL_HOUSE, list the set of 3 before the pair. 
If an Ace counts a low in determining a hand, this is also represented in the ordering.

WORKED EXAMPLE

Line 1 : TC JC
Line 2 : AD 4S
Line 3 : 2H 7H TH QS KC

Player 1's 7-card hand: TC JC + 2H 7H TH QS KC.
Player 2's 7-card hand: AD 4S + 2H 7H TH QS KC.

Player 1's best 5-card hand is a PAIR of tens (TC & TH), and the kickers are KC, QS & JC.
Player 2's best 5-card hand is a HIGH_CARD (AD), and the kickers are KC, QS, TH & 7H.

A PAIR beats a HIGH_CARD so Player 1 wins. Thus the output would be:

1 PAIR TTKQJ

Input
Line 1 : holeCardsPlayer1, the 2 hole cards for Player 1, separated by a space.
Line 2 : holeCardsPlayer2, the 2 hole cards for Player 2, separated by a space.
Line 3 : communityCards, the 5 cards on the board, separated by a space.

Output
If there's a winner, the output is WinningPlayerId HandType OrderedFiveCardHand, space-separated. If not, the output is simply DRAW.
WinningPlayerId is 1 or 2.
HandType is as specified above.
OrderedFiveCardHand is the winning 5 cards combination's values, in the order specified above.

Examples:

1 HIGH_CARD AKQ72
2 PAIR 55AKQ
1 FULL_HOUSE 22233
DRAW
2 FLUSH 97643
1 STRAIGHT 76543

Constraints
All deals are valid. (all cards exist, no duplicate cards are dealt)
