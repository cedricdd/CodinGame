Goal
You saw the success your brother had as a manufacturer and installer of Floor-Tiles in the original “Tile a Floor” puzzle. 
So you start a rival business doing something similar but different, specializing in what you call the bdpq-effect.

The beauty of Tiles comes from their symmetry, in that the quadrants of a Tile are mirror/reflections of each other.

So, when you get an order for a Tile, only the pattern of the top left quadrant is the input.
Graphically explained here:

☑☑☑☐☐☐
☑☑☑☐☐☐
☑☑☑☐☐☐
☐☐☐☐☐☐
☐☐☐☐☐☐
☐☐☐☐☐☐

From that limited input, your task is to:
Create a full Tile
And display a 2x2 floor (i.e., a floor consisting of 4 of those Tiles)

Flip/Mirror patterns:
Generally, a character appearing in the first quadrant just replicates in the other quadrants.
However, your beautiful Tiles exploit the particular symmetry of:

b d
p q

and

\/
/\

For those, you'll want to put the proper reflected/flipped version in each quadrant.

Details:
➤ You only make square Tiles, where the side-length is an even number
➤ Each Tile is a square; the input therefore is also a square
➤ The input has a side-length of quarterSize; therefore the full Tile has a side-length of 2*quarterSize
➤ The full floor needs a grout border, and grout separating the individual Tiles. Grout is represented by - on top/bottom, | on left/right, and + on corners


Happy trowelling

Input
Line 1: An integer quarterSize, denoting the number of rows of Tile pattern in the top left quadrant
Next quarterSize lines: row of Tile pattern in the top left quadrant

Output
The entire floor

Constraints
3 ≤ quarterSize ≤ 7
