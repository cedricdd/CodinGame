Goal
The NATO alphabet is the standard now for using a word to indicate the letter that word starts with:
"Lima Echo Oscar" for "Leo" (for example)

But did you know that there have been multiple other attempts at this ?
(Just for fun, you can read more about that fascinating history/story at the MentalFloss link far below.)

Following are 4 of those alphabet-attempts along with the year each started.

You task is to:
~ upgrade the input to the next version, or
~ if it's already in the newest version, to degrade it to the oldest version
