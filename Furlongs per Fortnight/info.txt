Goal
Background:
Most of the world uses the "metric system" but the United States still uses the "imperial system" which has all sorts of interesting units of distance (some more common than others)

Speed is simply some-distance per some-time

Your task:
This puzzle inputs a inputSpeed expressed in dist1(unit of distance) per time1(unit of time)

Your challenge is to convert that to another dist2(unit of distance) per time2(unit of time)

Units of distance:
◆ 1 mile = 8 furlongs
◆ 1 furlong = 10 chains
◆ 1 chain = 22 yards
◆ 1 yard = 3 feet
◆ 1 foot = 12 inches

Units of time:
◆ 1 fortnight = 2 weeks
◆ 1 week = 7 days
◆ 1 day = 24 hours
◆ 1 hour = 60 minutes
◆ 1 minute = 60 seconds

In a speed expression:
~ a distance uses its plural version, such as yards, feet, inches (except for the rare occasion when the speed is exactly 1, which this puzzle doesn't include)
~ a time uses its singular version, such as hour, minute


Input
A string: inputSpeed dist1 per time1 CONVERT TO dist2 per time2
where inputSpeed is an integer and the rest are strings

Output
A string: convertedSpeed dist2 per time2
where convertedSpeed is a float rounded to nearest 1/10
