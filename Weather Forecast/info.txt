Goal
Note: please complete Hunger before completing this puzzle.

Bob is trying to implement a more advanced feature into his weather forecasting system: the longest time that's valid for camping. 
A day is considered to be a good day for camping if the average temperature of that day is between A and B degrees (inclusive). 
All other days are considered to be bad days for camping.

Bob considers a range of days from L to R (inclusive) to be valid camping days if the number of good days within that interval is strictly greater than the number of bad days within the same interval.

Bob's weather forecasting system can forecast N days forward into the future. Please help Bob implement his new feature.

Input
Line 1: 3 space-separated integers N, A, B.
Line 2: N space-separated integers t1, t2, ... , tN. representing the temperatures of day 1 to day N

Output
2 space-separated integers L and R such that the range of days from L to R (inclusive) is the longest possible camping interval that is considered to be valid.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 3.2 × 104
-9 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 50
-9 ≤ ti ≤ 50 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ N
It's guaranteed that there exists at least one good day.
