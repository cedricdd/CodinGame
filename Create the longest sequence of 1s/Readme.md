# Puzzle
**Create the longest sequence of 1s** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/create-the-longest-sequence-of-1s

# Goal
Given some bitstring b, you may change one bit from a 0 to a 1 in order to create the longest possible sequence of consecutive 1s. Output the length of the resulting longest sequence.

Example: 11011101111  
Flipping the second 0 results in 11011111111, where the longest sequence of 1s is 8 long.

# Input
* Line 1: The bitstring b

# Output
* Line 1: The length of the longest possible sequence of 1s after flipping one bit

# Constraints
* 0 < number of bits in b < 1000
* b contains at least one 0
