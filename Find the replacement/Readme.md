# Puzzle
**Find the replacement** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/find-the-replacement

# Goal
In a lot of clash of code problems, you need to replace text from one form to the other.   
To figure it out quickly, you have decided to write a program to look at two lines and extract the replacement sequences (if any) that will convert Line X into Line Y. Hurry!

# Input
* Line 1: Text X.
* Line 2: Text Y, with the same length as text X.

# Output
* If not possible: One line: CAN'T
* If X and Y are equal: One line: NONE
* Otherwise, each line (in the order they appear in X): FROM -> TO

# Constraints
* 0 < Length of X, Y < 100
