Goal
You have just inherited of a small land of width W and height H with some trees in it and you had the idea to grow a forest.
But you have only 1 seed to plant.
Find the maximum number of trees after 33 years you can have by planting the seed at one of the best place.

Rules:
-Seeds need 10 years to grow as a Tree.
-Trees produce 4 seeds around them after one year.
-Trees may be already present on your land, they will produce seed after one year too.

Year 0 : With X as your one and only seed and Y a tree already present

Input
Line 1 : an integer W for the width of the parcel.
Line 2 : an integer H for the height of the grid.
Next H lines : each line of the land, with trees (Y) or grass (.).

Output
Line 1 : an integer N for the number of trees you can have on your land by 33 years by planting your seed at the best place.

Constraints
