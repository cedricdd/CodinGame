# Puzzle
**The max surface box** https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-max-surface-box

# Goal
Bob is playing LEGO. He has N small bricks. Each brick is a cube 1x1x1.  
Using ALL the bricks, Bob is building a big "block". This block should be a plain cuboid (i.e. no empty space inside).  

Bob is interested in the external surface of the block (=sum of the area of the 6 faces) he has constructed.  
What are the minimum and maximum possible surface areas for his block?  

# Input
* An integer N, the number of small bricks

# Output
* One line, with two integers separated by space.
* First integer is the minimum surface.
* Second integer is the maximum surface.

# Constraints
* 1 <= N <= 1 500 000
