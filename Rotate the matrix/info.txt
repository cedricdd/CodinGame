Goal
Once upon a time, in a peaceful village, there was a child named Kevin. Kevin loved playing with matrices, those grids of numbers that intrigued him so much.

One day, Kevin drew a square matrix on a piece of paper and added an exciting challenge: "Rotate the matrix by anti-clockwise by 45 degrees"

Kevin then embarked on a stimulating adventure, seeking to solve this mystery. Guided by his passion for challenges, he embarked on a fascinating journey through mathematical puzzles.

Elements in the output are separated by space and center-aligned.

Input
Line 1 An integer N for matrix size
Line 2 Matrix matrix a matrix separated by -

Output
matrix anti-clockwise by 45 degrees
Nb : Do not remove the space characters on the end in the each line of output

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 20
Every element in matrix is a single character
