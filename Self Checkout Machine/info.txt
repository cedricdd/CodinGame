Goal
You are tasked with creating a solution for how much change is required from a self-checkout machine based on the customer bill, 
the cash they put in and the available cash in that machine.

CHANGE
Notes: 50, 20, 10, 5
Coins: 2, 1, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01

NOTATION
All cash in machine and output change to customer must be formatted in notation
1X20+2X10+5X1 = 1 of 20 note, 2 of 10 note and 5 of 1 coins. Total is 45.

You must always output the highest denomination of any notes & coins that is available.

EXAMPLE
Customer change = 50
Output will be: 2X20+1X10 (when available)

NOTES
Customers will always enter more than or equal cash for their bill.
Print ERROR: OUT OF MONEY if the machine cannot output the complete change required.
If you have a J in place of the count of note/coin, this means the machine will jam (but only when that note/coin is dispensed). 
In this case output ERROR: JAM
If there is an error of any kind, all other customers are NOT processed.
If no change is due output: 0

Input
Line 1: An string cash for the machines starting cash reserves.
Line 2: An integer n for the number of customers.
Next n lines: Space separated float customer_bill cash_given

Output
n lines of customers: Cash returned in notation or some ERROR

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10
