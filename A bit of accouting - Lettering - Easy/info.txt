Goal
As a developer in an accounting company, you are tasked with developing a program that performs the lettering of a payment entry with one or more invoices.

Lettering is like matching your payment entries with your bills. It’s a way to keep track of which payments have cleared for which invoices, kind of like when you check off items on a shopping list.

You will be giving a list of invoices and a list of payment entries on a bank statement. You must match one entry with one or more invoices and associate a letter to this match.
Matches are output in the same order of the payment entries. Letters are assigned to each match, starting with A, then B and so on. In case a payment entry is matched to multiple invoices, the invoices are output in the given order. There is no way to match a payment entry multiple times.

Example :
You got the list of invoice amounts : [30, 42, 27] and the list of payment entry amounts : [27, 30, 42].
By associating a letter to each payment entry => A 27 / B 30 / C 42 you have to match one or more invoices to each.
That give :
A 27 - 27
B 30 - 30
C 42 - 42

Input
Line 1: An integer N representing the number of invoices
Line 2: An integer M representing the number of payment entries
Next N lines: An integer invoice representing the amount of a invoice
Next M lines: An integer paymentEntry representing the amount of a payment entry

Output
K lines: A B - C : One match where A is the letter of the lettering, B the amount of payment entry and C the amounts of invoices. Payment entry amount and invoice amounts are separated by a dash -. Invoice amounts are separated by a space.

Constraints
There are no cases where a match can only be made between multiple payment entries with one or multiple invoices, e.g.
A 2 4 - 6
B 2 4 - 1 5

1 ≤ K ≤ 26
