Goal
Background:
In the 1997 movie "Contact", Jodie Foster portrays a SETI scientist who finds evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact.

Her group is given cryptic instructions** for how aliens want them to build a machine to facilitate this contact.
(Maybe that worked, maybe not; no spoilers here.)

This scenario:
In a sequel to that story, the aliens once again attempt to communicate how they want us Earthlings to build something:
This time it's a Square Spiral (squareSpiral), as a potential-vehicle for some wild space-time multiverse travel adventures.

Your task:
Figure out what they mean, and build it.

What to output:
The output is generally the entire squareSpiral.
However if the sideSize is greater than 31, just output the top-left section (of size 31x31) of squareSpiral.

Caution: Letters don't wrap-around. If you get to either end of the alphabet, there is no more "material" available after that.
(This variation is shown in Test/Validator #21 and #22)

**NOT needed to solve this puzzle but see this clip for context: https://youtu.be/Q399v-pMG30?t=88

Input
Line 1: A String, the cryptic instructions in the format of

an Integer sideSize, which is the length of a side of the desired squareSpiral, followed by

a word which is either topLeft or topRight or bottomRight or bottomLeft, followed by

a word, which is either clockwise or counter-clockwise, followed by

two short Strings (separated by a space) ...hmmm.... what is this?? . . . it looks like maybe some sort of pattern

Output
sideSize Lines: squareSpiral
(or a 31x31 section of it, if it's larger than that)

Constraints
5 ≤ sideSize ≤ 201

sideSize is an odd integer

squareSpiral includes only spaces and uppercase letters
