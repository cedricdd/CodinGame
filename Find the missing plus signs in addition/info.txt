Goal

The sum of a set of N integers is S
Unfortunately, the plus signs have disappeared and the integers have been concatenated in a string O...
You have to find the positions of the plus signs to recover the addition.
If there is no solution , then print "No solution", otherwise print the solution(s) in lexicographic order ( 1+11 before 11+1 ).

Input
Line 1 : An integer N as the number of terms in the addition
Line 2 : An long integer S as the sum of the N integers
Line 3 : A string O as the concatenation of the N integers

Output
Line : If there is no solution, print "No solution"
otherwise print the solution(s), one per line, ordered in lexicographic order (+ before 0,1,2,3...) :
formatted as a valid equation a1+a2+...+aN=S

Constraints
2<=N<=10
