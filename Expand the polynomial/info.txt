Goal
You are given a polynomial that is partially or fully factorized and you have to write a code that fully expands it.
For example, if you are given (x-1)*(x+2)=xÂ²+x-2, its coefficients that are 1 1 -2 and you have to write x^2+x-2.

Input
A partially or not factorized polynomial.

Output
The expanded polynomial written in the standard way:
* x^1 is written x
* 1x^3 is written x^3
* 0x^2 and x^0 are not written

Constraints
All the coefficients are integers (positive, null or negative).
All coefficients are in decreasing order: (x^3 then x^2 then x^1 then x^0)
