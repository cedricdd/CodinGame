Goal
Big picture:
You are a Real Estate investor looking for houses-for-sale where the price is significantly less than expected, with the hopes that this will help you make a profit.

Your task:
expectedPrice is calculated using the averagePriceForSqFoot for the State that house is located in.
(This info for each State is provided in the stub.)

A house is "undervalued" if its price is less than expectedPrice.
Output each house that is undervalued (undervaluedAmount) by at least $25,000.
Print in descending order of that undervaluedAmount.

Then print the total of all those undervaluedAmounts, which is your potential profit.


Notes:
• Some States are two words, like New York.
• When calculating expectedPrice, round to nearest dollar amount.
