**Squash Pi** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/squash-pi

# Goal
Print out the requested digits of pi.

Hint: The easiest way to solve this is to just store the first 295k digits of pi in your program. But you are limited to 100k characters, so it is 'easy' but not 'very easy'.

# Input

* Second line: The number of digits to print N .

# Output
* One line with the requested sequence.

# Constraints
* INDEX < 295,000
