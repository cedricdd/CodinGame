Goal
Your program must determine the possible exits of a maze.
The maze can have several exits or none, and may contain loops or parts that cannot be reached from the starting point.

INPUT:
Line 1: two ints W and H representing the width and height of the maze.
Line 2: two ints X and Y representing your start position in the maze.
H following lines: one row of the maze. A . represents an empty cell and a # represents a wall that cannot be traversed.

OUTPUT:
Line 1: an integer N representing the number of exits.
N following lines: two ints EX and EY representing the coordinates of each exit, given ordered by EX, then by EY (i.e. 2 10 comes before 5 1).

CONSTRAINTS:
7<=W<=21
7<=H<=21
