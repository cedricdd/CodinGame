Goal
Imagine that each field (or backyard or neighborhood park) has its own ecosystem and society, in which one type of animal functions as Cop and another type of animal functions as Robber.

What is the distance between the Cop and the Robber that are closest to each other?

Distance details:
‣ each emoji is 10 feet away from its neighbor above and from its neighbor to the left
‣ distance is measured "as the crow flies" (aka Euclidean distance)

Note: Often there are multiple Cops and/or multiple Robbers

Input
Line 1: emoji of Cop and emoji of Robber (not separated by a space)
Line 2: The height of the rectangular field you will search
Next height Lines: The field

Output
Line 1: An integer, distance rounded to the nearest integer
