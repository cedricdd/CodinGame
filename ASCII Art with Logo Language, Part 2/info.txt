Goal
Your job is to extend the Logo language developed in ASCII Art with Logo Language with the ability for our Turtle to move diagonally and some new commands
(so to check how resilient is your first implementation to the never ending dance of changing requirements).
SETPC pen: uses cyclically the characters in pen as Turtle pen, changing every Turtle's step (of length 1) with pen down. ; can't be used in pen.
RT angle: RIGHT. Turns Turtle right for number of degrees specified (only positive multiples of 45).
LT angle: LEFT. Turns Turtle left for number of degrees specified (only positive multiples of 45).
RP loop [commands]: REPEAT. This instruction repeats the commands that are inside the square brackets the number of times indicated by the loop parameter.

For example:
RP 2 [FD 2]

is equivalent to
FD 2;FD 2

REPEAT command can be nested. For example:
RP 2 [RP 2 [RT 90;FD 2]]

is equivalent to
RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2

setpc 12345;rt 90;fd 5

produces
12345

Input
Line 1: An integer N, indicating the program's number of lines.
Next N lines: lines of text with Logo instructions.

Output
The ASCII Art generated.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 2000
angle: a positive integer multiple of 45.
loop: a positive integer from 1 to 100.
pen: an ASCII string excluding spaces and semicolon.
