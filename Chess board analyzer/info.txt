Goal
Find the winner (W or B) for the given chess board. If there isn't a King in checkmate position output N.

You have to make several assumptions:
- The given boards are legal and are assuming the official Chess rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess
- In every board there is a winner (no draws) or the board is not terminal (the game could be continued)
- An attacked King could be saved only by moving himself to a safe square (not by using another piece from the King's team)
- White pawns are moving upwards, while black pawns are moving downwards

Example board:

........
.......k
........
........
........
......R.
.K.....R
........


In this example the white rooks (uppercase R letters) are attacking all the squares the black king (lowercase k letter) could move onto, 
so the black king is in checkmate position and the white (W) player wins.

Input
8 lines: Each line contains 8 characters, which are representing a row on the board to analyze.

Characters can be:

. - Not occupied square on the board
R - White Rook
N - White Knight
B - White Bishop
Q - White Queen
K - White King
P - White Pawn
r - Black Rook
n - Black Knight
b - Black Bishop
q - Black Queen
k - Black King
p - Black Pawn

Output
W or B for the winning player or N if the game could be continued.
