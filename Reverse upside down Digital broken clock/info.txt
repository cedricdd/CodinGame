Goal
Julian's kids played with their alarm clock, and now the embedded projector displays the time ...
well ... upside down on the wall : reversed horizontally and vertically !

More explicitly, on the their room's wall the digits are now in reversed order, and :
- 0 is now readable as O or 0,
- 1 is now readable as i or 1,
- 2 is still displayed 2,
- 3 is now readable as E,
- 4 is now readable as h,
- 5 is now readable as S or 5,
- 6 is now readable as 9,
- 7 is now readable as L,
- 8 is still displayed 8,
- 9 is now readable as 6.

Given a readableText, output the realTime formatted as H:mm.

Be careful, some texts may now refer to invalid time !
If the realTime is not valid, output instead one or more lines to explain what is wrong, using the following format :
-> if one or more invalid chars => print Error : invalid invalid chars (-> no Test Cases yet .. coming soonðŸ˜‰)
-> if hours is NOT valid => then print Error hours hours
-> if minutes is NOT valid => then print Error minutes minutes

Input
Line 1 : the readableText (string) projected on the wall

Output
If realTime is valid => then print the realTime in 24 hours format H:mm

If realTime is NOT valid => then output one or more lines to explain what is wrong :
-> if one or more invalid chars => print Error : invalid invalid chars (-> no Test Cases yet .. coming soonðŸ˜‰)
-> if hours â‰¥ 24 => print Error hours hours
-> if minutes â‰¥ 60 => print Error minutes minutes

Constraints
If readableText is valid :
-> contains the : separator
-> 0 â‰¤ hours â‰¤ 99
-> 0 â‰¤ minutes â‰¤ 99
