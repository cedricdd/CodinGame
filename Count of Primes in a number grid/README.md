# Puzzle
**Count of Primes in a number grid** https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/count-of-primes-in-a-number-grid

# Goal
Given a grid of single digit numbers in R rows and C columns, count the number of distinct primes that can be found using Across or Down reading order. Partial use of the numbers in any direction is allowed, but skipping digits is not.

*Example: In the grid below:*  
```
2 3
1 7
```

The primes that can found are : 2, 3, 7, 17, 23, 37. So, the output would be 6. Note that 13 and 71 are not counted as they are not a result of using the across or down reading order.

# Input
* Line 1: Two numbers R and C, separated by a single space.
* Next R lines: Depicts a grid of single digit numbers, separated by a single space.

# Output
* One single number depicting the count of distinct primes found in the grid. Do not count duplicates.

# Constraints
* 2 <= R <= 8
* 2 <= C < =8
