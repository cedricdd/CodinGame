Goal
Burt studies math but is too dumb to derive fancy formulas, so he solves his homework problems using random numbers.

Given an American roulette wheel with 38 possible outcomes (0-36 or 00), what are the odds of landing on at least m different numbers in n spins?

Input
Line 1: m
Line 2: n

Output
The probability rounded to the nearest percent.

Constraints
1 ≤ m ≤ 38
m ≤ n ≤ 50
