Goal
Given two integers, low and high, return how many strobogrammatic numbers are present in that range, inclusive.

A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).

The first few strobogrammatic numbers are:
0, 1, 8, 11, 69, 88, 96, 101

Input
Line 1: The lower integer of the range
Line 2: The higher integer of the range

Output
Line 1: The number of strobogrammatic numbers in the range

Constraints
0 ≤ low ≤ 1 x 10¹⁷
0 ≤ high ≤ 1 x 10¹⁷
low ≤ high
