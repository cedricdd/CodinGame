**Strobogrammatic Numbers**  https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/strobogrammatic-numbers

# Goal
Given two integers, low and high, return how many strobogrammatic numbers are present in that range, inclusive.

A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).

The first few strobogrammatic numbers are: 0, 1, 8, 11, 69, 88, 96, 101
