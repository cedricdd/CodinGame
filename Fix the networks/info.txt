Goal
John's boss asked him to provision some networks for the company. John is an experienced network engineer, so the problem should be pretty straightforward. However, it was late at night, and he had a bit too much to drink, so he messed up a few of the numbers. Please help John fix the problem!

A CIDR range consists of a prefix and a suffix. The prefix consists of four 8-bit numbers B separated by a dot, which represents a 32-bit IP address. For example, 10.0.0.8 is an IP address. The suffix is a number S between 0 and 32 inclusive, which tells us how many bits are fixed, counting from the left. This means that the remaining bits are variable. These bits determine the number of addresses N available to the CIDR range.
The prefix and the suffix are separated by a forward slash. An example of a CIDR range is 10.0.0.8/24.
A CIDR range is valid if all of the variable bits are 0.

For example:
192.168.2.0/24 is a valid CIDR range because when converted to binary, the last 8 bits are all 0:
11000000 . 10101000 . 00000010 . 00000000

192.168.10.0/20 is an invalid range because when the prefix is converted to binary, the last 12 bits are not all 0:
11000000 . 10101000 . 00001010 . 00000000

We can fix it by changing the above CIDR range to 192.168.10.0/23. Now the last 9 bits are all 0:
11000000 . 10101000 . 00001010 . 00000000

Given a M number of CIDR ranges, validate each range and print the result. If a range is valid, print the number of addresses it can hold. If it is invalid, correct the suffix so that the resulting CIDR range will have the highest number of addresses possible. Print the new CIDR range and the number of addresses.

Input
Line 1: An integer M for the number of CIDR ranges
Next M lines: CIDR range

Output
If the CIDR range is valid, print valid, and then print N for the number of addresses
If the CIDR range is invalid, print invalid, the new CIDR range, and then N for the number of addresses of the new range.

Constraints
1 <= M <= 5
0 <= B <= 255
0 <= S <= 32
1 <= N <= 4294967296
