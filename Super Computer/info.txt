 Rules
Scientists give you the starting day of their calculation and the number of consecutive days they need to reserve the calculator.


Input

Line 1: The number N of calculations
The N following lines: on each line, the starting day J and the duration D of reservation, separated by a blank space.

Output
The maximum number of calculations that can be carried out.

Constraints
0 < N < 100000
0 < J < 1000000
0 < D < 1000
