**Retaining Water** https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/retaining-water

# Goal
François designs above-ground swimming pools for the bourgeoisie. His designs are represented by an NxN grid of letters, with heights ranging from A=1 to Z=26. Find the volume of water each pool can hold.

# Input
* Line 1: The size N of the grid.
* Next N lines: The grid values.

# Output
* The volume of water that the pool can hold. Outside the pool the height is 0, so no water is held on the cells at the edge of the pool. 
* The water does not leak diagonally. You can think of the puzzle as a bunch of blocks, take a look at the cover picture for illustration.

# Constraints
* 10 ≤ N ≤ 40
