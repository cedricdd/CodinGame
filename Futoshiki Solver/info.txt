Goal
Futoshiki is a Japanese numeric logic puzzle similar to the more popular Sudoku.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki
Like in Sudoku, in a Futoshiki of size n every row and every column must contain every number from 1 to n.
Unlike Sudoku there may be greater than / less than relations between cells.

For a n×n Futoshiki the input will be 2n-1 lines of digits 0..n (0 meaning empty), 
and either spaces or inequality constraints ^ v < > separating the digits of length 2n-1.

^ meaning the cell below the symbol has a higher value than the one above the symbol and so on.


Example: A 2×2 Futoshiki

0>0
v ^
0<0

having the solution:

21
12

Input
Line 1: number size of lines to read
Next size lines:
- even-numbered lines: string of length size alternating between a number 0..n and a space or < or >.
- odd-numbered lines: string of length size containing spaces and v or ^ on even-numbered positions and spaces on odd-numbered positions.

Output
n lines: n digits for each row of the solved board
(for n such that size = 2×n - 1)

Constraints
There is only 1 correct solution to each board.
1 ≤ size ≤ 13
