Goal
Bo moved to the countryside and needed a side gig.

He'd noticed lots of signs on the roadside like "EGGS FOR SALE" and "CORN MAZE AHEAD" and "REPENT NOW"; and thought maybe he could make some money by writing out messages for people, in a unique way.

He’d seen that the letters in "Make an Atari Font" puzzle (at https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/make-an-atari-font) 
resembled hay-bales stacked on top of each other, and he had lots of hay-bales.

So a business idea was born: Bo's Hay-Bale Messages.
Bo will build each letter of the customer's message, using hay-bales.

He has asked you to write a program to automatically generate price quotes for potential customers.

Most letters will require hay-bales of two different colors:
• the actual letterColor, and
• the backgroundColor because gravity exists and hay-bales can't just hover in space. 
For example: the hay-bales creating the top of a T will have to be stacked on top of "supporting" hay-bales (that are the backgroundColor)

The price for each hay-bale:
• plain: $3
• painted black or white or any of the primary color: $1 more
• painted any of the secondary colors (violet, orange, or green): $2 more
• painted a custom color: $3 more

Given the input of the message, the chosen letterColor and the chosen backgroundColor, calculate the price

NOTE:
Letters in the Atari font don't use all 8 available lines/levels; some are blank.
You don't need any hay-bales for any totally blank level, on the bottom.
In other words, place letters directly on the ground.

Input
Line 1: A string message
Line 2: A string letterColor
Line 3: A string backgroundColor

Output
Line 1: An integer, the price

Constraints
message is upper-case letters (and spaces) only.
letterColor and backgroundColor are all lower case.
