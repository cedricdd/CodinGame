Goal
Given a string representing a simple fraction X/Y, you must output a string representing the corresponding mixed fraction in the following format:

[sign]A B/C

where A is integer part and B/C is irreducible proper fraction. There must be exactly one space between A and B/C.

Some rules must be followed:

1. If X/Y equals the integer part, return integer part only (and ignore Rule 2).
2. If integer part is zero, return the irreducible proper fraction only.
3. In cases where rules (1) or (2) apply, the result must not contain any spaces.
4. In case of division by zero, output DIVISION BY ZERO.
5. The sign of the resulting number applies to this number as a whole and if the sign is negative, it is placed before the number without a space after the sign. Zero does not have a sign.

Examples:

Input: 42/9, expected result: 4 2/3.
Input: 6/3, expected result: 2.
Input: 4/6, expected result: 2/3.
Input: 0/18891, expected result: 0.
Input: -10/7, expected result: -1 3/7.
Inputs 0/0 or 3/0 must output DIVISION BY ZERO.

Input
Number of tests N.
Next N lines: Two integers separated by a slash: X/Y.

Output
The resulting mixed number, one per line.

Constraints
-10000000 < X < 10000000
-10000000 < Y < 10000000
