Goal
Given two strings a and b, in how many ways we can erase characters from a such that we end up with the string b? 
Take in mind that the order of operations matters.

Explanation for example 1:
aba -> ab -> b
aba -> ba -> b
Those transformations are considered different.

Input
Line 1: String a
Line 2: String b

Output
Line 1:The answer modulo (remainder when divided by) 998244353.

Constraints
1 ≤ length of b ≤ length of a ≤ 500
Both strings will only contain lowercase English letters.
