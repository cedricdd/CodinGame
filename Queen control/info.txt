Goal
Chess is played on an 8x8 board composed of 64 squares. In this game it is important to control a large amount of these squares to gain the upper hand on the opponent. 
A square is said to be controlled when it is in the range of movement of a chess piece.

The chess piece that can control the most squares is the queen. It can move on any square vertically, horizontally and diagonally.

Your mission : Create a program able to calculate the number of squares controlled by the queen in a specific given position.

A square is considered to be controlled when the queen can move to it.
- A square containing a piece of the same color isn't considered controlled.
- But a square containing a piece of the opposite color can be considered controlled.
- The square the queen is currently on isn't counted.

Input
Line 1 : The color of the queen (white or black)
Next 8 lines : A string line of 8 characters describing the chess board.

. = Empty square
Q= The queen
w = White piece
b = Black piece

Output
Line 1 : An integer corresponding to the number of squares controlled by the queen
