Goal
You are working for a construction company, your new task is to optimize the construction of floors by finding the cheapest way to build them. 
The owner of the only supplier of floor blocks is a big fan of the game Tetris and for this reason all the blocks they produce are shaped like the pieces of the game. 
The price of each type of block varies with time but the supplier can provide you as many blocks as you want.

Here's the blocks you can use:

Type 1:   Type 2:   Type 3:   Type 4:   Type 5:   Type 6:   Type 7:
####      ##        ###       ###       ###       ##         ##
          ##         #        #           #        ##       ##


The pragmatic in you immediately realize that simply ordering only the cheapest type and breaking them down to 1x1 block would let you fill any kind of floor. 
The last person who tried to do that has vanished without a trace, you don't mess with Tetris pieces without consequences. 
If breaking pieces isn't an option, rotating them is perfectly fine.

Some part of the floor will already be occupied, these are walls, pillars, ... and don't need to be covered but everything has to be, you can't leave holes in the floor, clients wouldn't be happy with that.

In addition to finding the cheapest set of blocks to order you also need to report how many variations can be created with the set of blocks while covering the floor.

For example with:
7 7
6.49 18.69 22.89 35.07 54.23 66.87 79.26
#######
#.....#
#.....#
#..#..#
#.....#
#.....#
#######

The cheapest set of blocks is: 4 0 0 2 0 0 0 with a price of 96.10 and there are 6 ways to place the blocks:
#######   #######   #######   #######   #######   #######
#----|#   #----|#   #|----#   #|----#   #||+--#   #|----#
#||-+|#   #|+--|#   #||-+|#   #|+--|#   #|||||#   #|----#
#||#||#   #||#||#   #||#||#   #||#||#   #||#||#   #+-#-+#
#|+-||#   #|--+|#   #|+-||#   #|--+|#   #|||||#   #----|#
#|----#   #|----#   #----|#   #----|#   #--+||#   #----|#
#######   #######   #######   #######   #######   #######

The set of blocks with the cheapest price will be unique in all the tests.

Input
Line 1: 2 integers, W & H, the width & height of the floor.
Line 2: 7 floats separated by a space (P1 to P7), the prices of each type of blocks.
Next H lines: Characters representing the floor, . represent a space to fill & # represent a space already filled.

Output
Line 1: The price to fill the floor. (float with 2 decimal precision)
Line 2: The quantity of each type of blocks needed to fill the floor. Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7
Line 3: The number of ways we can use the set of blocks.

Constraints
7 <= w <= 100
7 <= h <= 100

0.0 <= Pi <= 100.0
