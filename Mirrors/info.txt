Goal
When z units of light shine on any side of a mirror with reflectivity r, rz units of light are reflected, and the other (1-r)z units of light pass through the mirror.
There are n mirrors numbered 1...n arranged in a row. Mirror i has reflectivity r_i. Find the total amount of light reflected back to the source when 1 unit of light shines on the first mirror.
Note that light can be reflected multiple times.
